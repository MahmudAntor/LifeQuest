# LifeQuest Project Overview

**LifeQuest** is a gamified task and goal management system inspired by RPG mechanics. The project currently includes:
- `Player` class for managing player stats and XP.
- `QuestManager` for handling daily and custom quests.
- `DailyQuest` class for individual quest creation and completion tracking.

The goal of LifeQuest is to create a modular system where users can track daily habits, set custom goals, and gain experience points (XP) by completing quests.
