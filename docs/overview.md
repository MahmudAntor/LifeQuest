# LifeQuest Project Overview

**LifeQuest** is a gamified task and goal management system inspired by RPG mechanics. The project includes:
- **Player Management**: The `Player` class handles player stats like XP, level, and completed quests.
- **Quest Management**: The `QuestManager` uses `Quest` and `UserQuest` models to manage global and user-specific quests.
- **Database Integration**: AWS DynamoDB stores player data, quest definitions, and quest progress.

The goal of LifeQuest is to create an engaging and modular system where users can track daily habits, set custom goals, and gain experience points (XP) by completing quests.
